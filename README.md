10. What is a Perceptron or a Single Layer Neural Network?
A Perceptron is the simplest type of artificial neural network model, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It is a single-layer neural network used for binary classification problems.

It takes multiple inputs, multiplies each with a weight, adds a bias and passes the result through an activation function.
If the output crosses a certain threshold, the perceptron outputs one class or otherwise, it outputs the other class.
Formula:

y
=
f
(
∑
(
w
i
⋅
x
i
)
+
b
)
y=f(∑(w 
i
​
 ⋅x 
i
​
 )+b)

where 
f
f is the activation function, 
x
i
x 
i
​
 ​ are inputs, 
w
i
w 
i
​
 ​ are weights and 
b
b is bias.

Example: Used for simple problems like checking whether a number is greater than a threshold (yes/no type outputs).
