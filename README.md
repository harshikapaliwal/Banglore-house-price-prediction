10. What is a Perceptron or a Single Layer Neural Network?
A Perceptron is the simplest type of artificial neural network model, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It is a single-layer neural network used for binary classification problems.

It takes multiple inputs, multiplies each with a weight, adds a bias and passes the result through an activation function.
If the output crosses a certain threshold, the perceptron outputs one class or otherwise, it outputs the other class.
